# Angular2Directives

These are the samples of Angular2 Directives.

# Component
    The Component is really a directive with a template. 
    It's the most common of the three directives and we write lots of them as we build our application.
    
# Structural Directives. 
    A Structural directive changes the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. 
    We've seen three of the built-in structural directives in other chapters: ngIf, ngSwitch and ngFor.
    
# Attribute Directives.
    The Attribute directive changes the appearance or behavior of an element. 
    The built-in NgStyle directive, for example, 
    can change several element styles at the same time. 
    We can use it to render text bold, italic, 
    and lime green by binding to a component property that requests such a sickening result.
    
# Custom Directives.
    Custom Directives are custom made Attribute directives.
