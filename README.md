# Angular2Directives

These are the samples of Angular2 Directives.

# Component
    Components are also directives. 
    Since directives are instructions components are directives because of the selectors, 
    whenever you use the custom tags which is the selector of your component you instruct or tell
    angular that you want to display the content(template/html) of your component.
    
# Structural Directives. 
    A Structural directives are one of the most usefull directives for me, because these are the one that manipulates
    and control the DOM or Html elements. 
    
# Attribute Directives.
    Attribute directive changes the appearance or behavior of an element. 
    You can control the styles and behavior of an element, you can modify several elements at the same time.
    
# Custom Directives.
    Custom Directives are custom made Attribute directives.
